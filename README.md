# Download and Installation

Once development has finished, a download link will be provided.

# What does this do?
This program was created to help close multiple program windows with a single button. Each program window is sent a message to safely close the window, and if it is unable to close it safely, the default window dialog box will be displayed for you to take the right action.

# How to use


# Why?

> Ease of use and necessity

## Case 
After work I would have about +10 windows open and this has made logging off work a lot quicker and simpler. 

This can be done through other means:
- Windows+Tab and clicking the X button on the top-right of each window that is open
- Classic ALT+F4 (Force closes the window)
- CTRL+SHIFT+ESC (Open Task Manager) and click "End Task" for each app.
- Other methods that I have not listed

The method I used to do was Windows+Tab, as I felt this was easier and safer incase I had unsaved work.
Using this app, I just click a single button and closes everything safely.
